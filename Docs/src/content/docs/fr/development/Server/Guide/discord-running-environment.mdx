## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Relevant Config Values

The majority of the setup should already be done based on the parent Getting Started page, but more information can be found from the [Config Reference](../config).

Please ensure you have the primary roles added, as well as the other sibling properties to `roles`.

## Running the Environment

Run the following command to start the discord bot in development mode:

```bash
npm run discord-bot-dev
```

Discord does not have an HTTP server instance, but it will say `Logged into discord as [DISCORD BOT USERNAME]` in console.\
You should be able to see the bot's slash commands when typing `/` in discord, and it should respond when sending a `!ping` message if you made sure to enable the `Message Content` privilege intent on the Discord application's page.
