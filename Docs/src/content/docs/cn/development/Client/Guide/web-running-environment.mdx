## 相关设定参数

Based on what config values you had provided for the website's `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port`, you should be able to access the website at `http://host:port`

For example, `http://localhost:3000` for the ayim website if your `config.ayim.host` is `localhost` and your `config.ayim.port` is `3000`.

`config.[WEBSITE].publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:3000`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

:::note
Make sure to start the API server if you haven't already.
:::

Depending on which website(s) you want to run, you will need to run the following command(s) in a separate terminal:

| Website | Cmd                    |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| AYIM    | `npm run ayim-dev`     |
| Closed  | `npm run closed-dev`\* |
| MCA     | `npm run mca-dev`      |
| Main    | `npm run main-dev`     |
| Open    | `npm run open-dev`     |

\*Currently does not exist

The website should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../config).
