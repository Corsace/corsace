## Setting up Scenes

<WorkInProgress section="Stream Setup/Setting Up Scenes" />

## Accessing Scenes

Once all scenes are made, streamers can access them through OBS browser sources. The discord command `/tournament_key` will provide the streamer the tournament's key to access the scenes. This is similarly outlined in the [Getting Started/Tournament key](../#tournament-key) documentation.

Once obtained, you can then access each of the scenes at `https://open.corace.io/stream/[STREAMPAGE]?key=[TOURNAMENTKEY]`. The stream page is the name of the scene you wish to access, such as `bracket`, `match`, `mappool`, etc.
