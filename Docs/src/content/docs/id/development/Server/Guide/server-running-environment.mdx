Typically, the API server is necessary to run any frontend website, so it is recommended to read this before reading the guides for frontend/client web development.

## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Relevant Config Values

Based on what config values you had provided for the server's `config.api.host` and `config.api.port`, you should be able to access the API server at `http://host:port`

For example, `http://localhost:8080` for the API server if your `config.api.host` is `localhost` and your `config.api.port` is `8080`.

`config.api.publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.api.host` and `config.api.port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:8080`.

The same would apply for the CronRunner within `config.cronRunner`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

Run the following command to start the API server in development mode:

```bash
npm run api-dev
```

The server should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../../../misc/reference/config)\
Accessing the page in the browser should show `Hello World!`.

### CronRunner

The CronRunner server instance is necessary for features such as tournament creation, and to run timed/cron jobs in general. It's a separate HTTP server instance that only communicates with other Corsace server instances.\
Run the following command to start the CronRunner server in development mode:

```bash
npm run cron-runner-dev
```

The server should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../../../misc/reference/config)\
Accessing the page in the browser should show `Hello World!`.
