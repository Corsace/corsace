## Prerequisite Reading

* [Development/Getting Started](../../..)
* [Development/Server/Guide/Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](/server-running-environment)

## Relevant Config Values

### Config/config.json

The majority of the setup should already be done based on the parent Getting Started page, but ensure that the `config.centrifugo.publicUrl` and `config.centrifugo.apiUrl` are pointing towards the same host/port, and that the port is free.

### centrifugo-config.json

In the main directory, there is a `centrifugo-config.json`.

Ensure that in `client.allowed_origins` that the value in `config.open.publicUrl` is the array value.\
Ensure that in `client.proxy.connect.endpoint` and `channel.proxy.subscribe.endpoint` that the value in `config.api.publicUrl` is there. It should consist of api endpoints `/api/centrifugo/connect` and `/api/centrifugo/subscribe` in there respectively.\
The value for `channel.namespaces[...].subscribe_proxy_enabled` should also be `true`.

For example, if my `config.open.publicUrl` was `http://localhost:7000`, and my `config.api.publicUrl` was `http://localhost:8080`, then my `centrifugo-config.json` would look like this:

```json
{
    ...,
    "client": {
        ...,
        "allowed_origins": [..., "http://localhost:7000", ...],
        "proxy": {
            "connect": {
                "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/centrifugo/connect",
                ...
            }
        }
    },
    ...,
    "channel": {
        "proxy": {
            "subscribe": {
                "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/centrifugo/subscribe",
                ...
            }
        },
        "namespaces": [
            {
                "name": "matchup",
                "subscribe_proxy_enabled": true,
                ...
            },
            ...
        ],
    ...
}
```

## Running the Environment

To reiterate from the parent Getting Started page, run the following command to start the centrifugo server in development mode:

```bash
npm run centrifugo
```

In the console, there should be no errors when running.

### Local Centrifugo

This is only for if the above doesn't work, which can happen in Windows/WSL.

Download a v6.x.x binary from [latest releases](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/releases), and place it in the parent directory.\
Afterwards, go to `scripts.centrifugo:local` in `package.json` located in the parent directory, and ensure it has the same port listed in `config.centrifugo.publicUrl` and `config.centrifugo.apiUrl`.
Once done, it should run using the following command

```bash
npm run centrifugo:local
```

In the console, there should be no errors when running.
