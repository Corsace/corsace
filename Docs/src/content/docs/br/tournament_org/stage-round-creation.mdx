## Defining Stages and Rounds

Before moving forward, a distinction needs to be clarified between stages and rounds:

```
    A stage is a collection of rounds or matches.
    A round is a collection of matches.
```

```
    A stage is typically an entire bracket, or a round robin, or a qualifiers stage.
    A round is typically within a bracket stage.
```

For example, if a tournament has qualifiers, and then a double elimination bracket of 32 teams, then:

* The qualifiers would be a stage.
* The double elimination bracket would be a stage.
* The double elimination bracket would have multiple rounds, which are:
  * Round of 32
  * Round of 16
  * Quarterfinals
  * Semifinals
  * Finals
  * Grand Finals

## Stage Creation

To create a stage, use the `/stage_create` command in an `admin` channel that you had designated during the [tournament creation](#tournament-creation) section. Ensure you fill in all the required parameters.

:::note
If you need to recheck which channels were considered `admin` channels, you can use the `/tournament_info` command with the `channels` parameter in `info_type` to get the list of channels and their types.
:::

When creating a single/double elimination stage, the Corsace Discord bot will automatically decide on and create the rounds for you. You currently cannot create/edit/delete rounds manually, but support for this is planned in the future.

## Next Steps

Once you have created a stage, you can proceed to [creating mappools](./mappool-creation) for the stages and rounds.
