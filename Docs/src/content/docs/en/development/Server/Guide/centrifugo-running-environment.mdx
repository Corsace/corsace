## Pre-requisite Reading
- [Development/Getting Started](../../..)
- [Development/Server/Guide/Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](/server-running-environment)

## Relevant Config Values

### Config/config.json
The majority of the setup should already be done based on the parent Getting Started page, but ensure that the `config.centrifugo.publicUrl` and `config.centrifugo.apiUrl` are pointing towards the same host/port, and that the port is free.

### centrifugo-config.json
In the main directory, there is a `centrifugo-config.json`.

Ensure that in `allowed_origins` that the value in `config.open.publicUrl` is the array value.\
Ensure that in `proxy_connect_endpoint` and `proxy_subscribe_endpoint` that the value in `config.api.publicUrl` is there. It should consist of api endpoints `/api/centrifugo/connect` and `/api/centrifugo/subscribe` in there respectively.\
The value for `proxy_subscribe` should also be `true`.

For example, if my `config.open.publicUrl` was `http://localhost:7000`, and my `config.api.publicUrl` was `http://localhost:8080`, then my `centrifugo-config.json` would look like this:
```json
{
    ...,
    "allowed_origins": [..., "http://localhost:7000", ...],
    ...,
    "proxy_connect_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/centrifugo/connect",
    ...,
    "proxy_subscribe_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/centrifugo/subscribe",
    ...,
    "proxy_subscribe": true
}
```

## Running the Environment

To reiterate from the parent Getting Started page, run the following command to start the centrifugo server in development mode:

```bash
npm run centrifugo
```
In the console, there should be no errors when running.

### Local Centrifugo

This is only for if the above doesn't work, which can happen in Windows/WSL.

Download the binary from [latest releases](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/releases), and place it in the parent directory.\
Afterwards, go to `scripts.centrifugo:local` in `package.json` located in the parent directory, and ensure it has the same port listed in `config.centrifugo.publicUrl` and `config.centrifugo.apiUrl`.
Once done, it should run using the following command
```bash
npm run centrifugo:local
```
In the console, there should be no errors when running.
