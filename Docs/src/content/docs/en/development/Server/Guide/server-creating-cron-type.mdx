This explains how to write functionality for creating cron jobs.\
Typically you will want to write a cron job when needing to run something after an extended period of time (say, an hour+ later) from now.\
This is better than creating a `setTimeout` function in terms of reliability, and also for performance and organization.\
This also solves the issue of persistence, as the cron will resume its timer whenever the instance begins again.

## Pre-requisite Reading
- [Development/Server/Guide/Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](../server-running-environment)

## Directory Structure
The primary code related to creating cron jobs and the CronRunner is in `Server/cron/cronFunctions`.\
While the file entry-point is at `Server/cron-runner.ts`, that file is nore relevant to creating a new type of cron job.\
The `Server/cron/index.ts` file is also not relevant for creating cron jobs, as it simply holds the class defintion we use for `Cron`.

`Interfaces/cron` exists to contain the general typing and interfaces created for CronRunner as well.

## CronJob Anatomy

### CronJob Type 

Before writing the CronJob's functionality, go to `Interfaces/cron`, and append your CronJob type's name `[CRON TYPE]` to the CronJobType like so:
```ts
export enum CronJobType {
    ...,
    [CRON TYPE],
}
...
```

### CronJob Functionality

Typically, there are only 2 functions required for a given CronJob:
- `initialize` - The function called initially to get the list of CronJobs of that type that exist in the database (if any/needed)
- `execute` - The function called when the cron's time is up.

You would primarily write the logic for the CronJob in a new file within `Server/cron/cronFunctions` called whatever you want it to.

Afterwards, the general structure of the file would be set up like so:
```ts
import { CronJobData, CronJobType } from "../../../Interfaces/cron";
...
async function initialize (): Promise<CronJobData[]> {
    ... // Write logic to obtain dates from DB here
    // The example below assumes a Date[] array called dateArray exists at the end
    // Everything below (including the comments) are within every cron job file

    // For each date, create a cron job with the end as the date.
    let cronJobs: CronJobData[] = dateArray.map(date => ({
        type: CronJobType[CRON TYPE],
        date,
    }));

    // If any dates are in the past, remove them and add a job to start instantly.
    if (cronJobs.some(j => j.date.getTime() < Date.now())) {
        cronJobs = cronJobs.filter(j => j.date.getTime() > Date.now());
        cronJobs.push({
            type: CronJobType.[CRON TYPE],
            date: new Date(Date.now() + 10 * 1000), // 10 second delay to avoid Date in past error
        });
    }

    return cronJobs;
}

async function execute (job: CronJobData) {
    ...
}

export default {
    initialize,
    execute,
};
```

## Installing CronJob

In `Server/cron/cronFunctions/index.ts`, simply append to the default export with the new enum type created in `Interfaces/cron` as its key, and the new code/file you have written in this same `cronFunctions` folder like so:
```ts
...
import [CRON TYPE]Execute from "./[CRON TYPE]"
import { CronJobType } from "../../../Interfaces/cron";

export default {
    ...,
    [CronJobType.[CRON TYPE]]: [CRON TYPE]Execute,
};
```

Afterwards, the `initialize` functionality should run whenever you start the CronRunner instance, and `execute` should run whenever a cron of your new type times out.
