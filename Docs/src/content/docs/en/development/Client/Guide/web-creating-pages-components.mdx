## Pre-requisite Reading
- [Development/Guide/Web - Running Environment](../web-running-environment)
- [Nuxt 2/Pages Directory](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/directory-structure/pages)
- [vue-class-component/Class Component](https://class-component.vuejs.org/guide/class-component.html)
- [BEM/Naming](https://getbem.com/naming/)

## Directory Structure
Pages are where they are expected based on Nuxt's directory structure. `[WEBSITE]/components`\
Components on the other hand are currently located at 2 places:
- If the component is used for 1 site only, then it will be in the `[WEBSITE]/components` folder (under that site's folder).
- If the component is used for multiple sites, then it will be in `Assets/components`.

:::caution
This may change in the near future based on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Corsace/Corsace/issues/292)

## Page/Component Anatomy

Corsace uses SASS/SCSS for styling everything, and ts for any scripting.\
Specifically for vue files, the `vue-property-decorator` decorators are used to create pages and components alike.
When you have created a vue file, the basic template that should be followed is as this:

```vue
<template>
    ...
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Vue, Component } from "vue-property-decorator";

@Component({
    ...
})
export default class [PAGE/COMPONENT CAMELCASE NAME] extends Vue {
    ...
}
</script>

<style lang="scss">
@import '@s-sass/[FILENAME FROM Assets/sass]';
</style>
```

## When to Make a Component
For this repository, the primary cases where you would want to split the code into its own component are when:
- The section of the HTML you are writing possibly/will be reused somewhere else
- The component **could** be considered/used by itself outside of its parent component (standalone)
- The complexity of the current page/component can be greatly reduced without increasing the complexity of the general repository

It is **highly recommended** to split parts of the code as necessary as possible to create ease of understanding and use, and to avoid DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Accessing Store

### Accessing Main Store
The main store file is located at `Assets/store/index.ts`. To access any variable from it's state, you simply add the following within the `script` section:
```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { State } from "vuex-class";
...
export default class [PAGE/COMPONENT CAMELCASE NAME] extends Vue {
    ...
    @State [VARIABLE'S NAME FROM STORE]!: [VARIABLE'S TYPES];
    ...
}
</script>
```

### Accessing Specific Store
To access a specific store, it is very similar to accessing the main store, but a `namespace` needs to be created first.\
For example, if you wish to access a variable in the `Assets/store/mca-ayim.ts` store state, you would do it like so:
```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { namespace } from "vuex-class";
...
const mcaAyimModule = namespace("mca-ayim");
...
export default class [PAGE/COMPONENT CAMELCASE NAME] extends Vue {
    ...
    @mcaAyimModule.State [VARIABLE'S NAME FROM STORE]!: [VARIABLE'S TYPES];
    ...
}
</script>
```

## SASS/SCSS and Styling Protocol
:::danger
To ensure BEM nomenclature clarity:
- A block is a "standalone section"
- An element is a "non-standalone section"
- A modifier is an "effect"

For example, `red` is not a block/element, it is a modifier at all times.
:::
As vue templates typically allow 1 child element only, and the styling nomenclature follows BEM, there is usually only 1 block with multiple elements and modifiers branching off it.\
For example:
```vue
<template>
    <tag class="block">
        <tag class="block__elem1">
            <tag class="block__elem1--mod1">
                ...
            </tag>
            ...
        </tag>
        ...
    </tag>
</template>
...
<style lang="scss">
...
.block {
    &__elem1 {
        &--mod1 {
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</style>
```

All style names should be done in `snake-case` instead of `camelCase`.\
For example: `mainPage` should instead be `main-page`.
