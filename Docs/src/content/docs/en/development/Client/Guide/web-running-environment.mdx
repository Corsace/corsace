## Pre-requisite Reading

- [Development/Server/Guide/Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](../../../server/guide/server-running-environment)

## Relevant Config Values

Based on what config values you had provided for the website's `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port`, you should be able to access the website at `http://host:port` 

For example, `http://localhost:3000` for the ayim website if your `config.ayim.host` is `localhost` and your `config.ayim.port` is `3000`.

`config.[WEBSITE].publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:3000`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

:::note
Make sure to start the API server if you haven't already.
:::

Depending on which website(s) you want to run, you will need to run the following command(s) in a separate terminal:

|Website| Cmd |
|--|--|
| AYIM | `npm run ayim-dev` |
| Closed | `npm run closed-dev`* |
| MCA | `npm run mca-dev` |
| Main | `npm run main-dev` |
| Open | `npm run open-dev` |

*Currently does not exist

The website should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../config).
