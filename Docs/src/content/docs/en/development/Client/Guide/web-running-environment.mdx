## Prerequisite Reading
- [Development/Getting Started](../../..)
- [Development/Server/Guide/Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](../../../server/guide/server-running-environment)

## Relevant Config Values

Based on what config values you had provided for the website's `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port`, you should be able to access the website at `http://[config.[WEBSITE].host]:[config.[WEBSITE].port]`. **Make sure you use different ports for each website**.

For example, `http://localhost:3000` for the ayim website if your `config.ayim.host` is `localhost` and your `config.ayim.port` is `3000`.

`config.[WEBSITE].publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:3000`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

:::note
Make sure to start the API server if you haven't already. See the [Server + CrunRunner - Running Environment](../../../server/guide/server-running-environment) guide for more information.
:::

Depending on which website(s) you want to run, you will need to run the following command(s) in a separate terminal:

|Website| Cmd |
|--|--|
| AYIM | `npm run ayim-dev` |
| Closed | `npm run closed-dev`* |
| MCA | `npm run mca-dev` |
| Main | `npm run main-dev` |
| Open | `npm run open-dev` |

*Currently does not exist

The website should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../config).

:::caution
If you are using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the host, and you are unable to see the website after running the command, you may need to check your hosts file to make sure they are connected (this may be necessary in Linux if not done already).
