This documentation provides information on how to create, run, and manage a tournament using Corsace services.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have logged in to the [Corsace website](https://corsace.io) at least once via osu! and discord before continuing.
- If you currently have a discord server for the tournament, ensure you are not (near) the 250 role limit.
