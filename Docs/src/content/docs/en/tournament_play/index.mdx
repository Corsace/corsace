This documentation provides information on the extra features provided for players, as well as any necessary information you may need to know while participating in a tournament run via Corsace services.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have logged in to the [Corsace website](https://corsace.io) at least once via osu! and discord before continuing.
- Ensure you have joined the discord server for the tournament you are participating in.

## Joining a team
:::note
Teams are necessary for joining any non-solo non-1v1 tournament. If you are looking to participate in a solo 1v1 tournament, you can skip this section.
:::

You can currently join a team either from the web, or from the Corsace Discord bot. The captain of the team must have invited you to the team before you can join.

### From the web
To join a team from the web, go to and log in to the [Corsace Open website](https://open.corsace.io). Once logged in, the menu's 3 lines should have a red dot if the captain had already invited you. Click menu -> invitations to be transferred to the team invites page. The invitations option should also have a red dot if you have any pending invites.

From here, you can click the `ACCEPT` button to join the team. You may also press `DECLINE` for any invites you do not wish to accept to clear them from your list.

### From the Corsace Discord bot
You can also join a team via the Corsace Discord bot. To do this, use the `/invite_accept` command in a channel where the Corsace Discord bot is present. Fill in the necessary parameters and the bot will send a request to the team captain to join the team.

You may also see a list of invites you have received by using the `/list_invites` command in a channel where the Corsace Discord bot is present.
