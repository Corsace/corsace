## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Relevant Config Values

Based on what config values you had provided for the website's `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port`, you should be able to access the website at `http://host:port`

For example, `http://localhost:3000` for the ayim website if your `config.ayim.host` is `localhost` and your `config.ayim.port` is `3000`.

`config.[WEBSITE].publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.[WEBSITE].host` and `config.[WEBSITE].port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:3000`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

### Running the API Server

You will likely need to have the server running to access the majority of the functionalities and pages any website in this repository provides. To do so, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run database
npm run api-dev
```

More information about the API server can be found [here](../../../server/guide/api-running-environment).

### Running the Website

Depending on which website(s) you want to run, you will need to run the following command(s) in a separate terminal:

| Website | Cmd                  |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| AYIM    | `npm run ayim-dev`   |
| Closed  | `npm run closed-dev` |
| MCA     | `npm run mca-dev`    |
| Main    | `npm run main-dev`   |
| Open    | `npm run open-dev`   |

The website should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../config).
