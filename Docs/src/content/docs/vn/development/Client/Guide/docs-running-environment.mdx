## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Relevant Config Values

Based on what config values you had provided for the website's `config.docs.host` and `config.docs.port`, you should be able to access the website at `http://host:port`

For example, `http://localhost:10000` if your `config.docs.host` is `localhost` and your `config.docs.port` is `10000`.

`config.docs.publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.docs.host` and `config.docs.port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:10000`.

See the [Config Reference](../../../misc/reference/config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

Run the following command to start the website in development mode:

```bash
npm run docs-dev
```

The website should now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../../../misc/reference/config).
