## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Relevant Config Values

The bancho instance creates an HTTP server in order to effectively communicate between the centrifugo and CronRunner instances. This is currently needed for refereeing.

Based on what config values you had provided for the server's `config.banchoBot.host` and `config.banchoBot.port`, you should be able to access the bancho server at `http://host:port`

For example, `http://localhost:8082` for the API server if your `config.banchoBot.host` is `localhost` and your `config.banchoBot.port` is `8082`.

`config.banchoBot.publicUrl` should be equivalent to `config.banchoBot.host` and `config.banchoBot.port` combined. In the example above, this would be `http://localhost:8082`.

See the [Config Reference](../config) for more information.

## Running the Environment

Run the following command to start the Bancho instance in development mode:

```bash
npm run bancho-bot-dev
```

There are currently no commands that can be run on bancho itself, but when fully loaded, it should say `Logged into Bancho as [YOUR USERNAME]` in console.\
The server should also now be available at the URL you configured in the [Config Reference](../../../misc/reference/config)\
Accessing the page in the browser should show `Hello World!`.
