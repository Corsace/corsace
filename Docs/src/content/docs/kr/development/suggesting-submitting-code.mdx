## Pre-requisite Reading

*   [Development/Getting Started](../../..)

## Ensure Fork Sync

:::caution
For anything outside of documentation work, it's highly suggested that you configure remote branching to keep your fork up to date.\
You can read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork)

Otherwise, you may easily sync with any option listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)\
The section below is assuming you have configured a remote upstream branch to the Corsace repository from your fork.
:::

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that your fork is fully synced with the latest commit in the Corsace repository in order to avoid merge conflicts.\
If you already committed changes A B C D E F G H I J to the code in your fork before updating, you can use the following git options:

```bash
git fetch [CORSACE REPOSITORY]
git rebase [CORSACE REPOSITORY]/master

git cherry-pick A B C F # To commit only specific commits you created since
# OR
git cherry-pick A^..J # Commit all of the commands you created since

git push -f 
#OR 
git push --force
```

`[CORSACE REPOSITORY]` is the name of the remote you created. You would most likely have called it `upstream` if you use the example GitHub provides.

This should now have you up to date to the latest commit on the Corsace repository alongside the commits you wanted.

## Submitting New/Changed Documents

Make sure to run `npm run lint` (as well as `npm run lintfix` for anything automatically fixable), and fix the issues that appear if any.
Create a Pull Request whenever ready. Currently, there is no specifications needed for PR/commit naming.\
Afterwards, ping VINXIS (`corsace.io` or `vinxis` on discord) or ThePooN (`thepoon` on discord) in the #dev channel in the [Corsace Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Z6vEMsr), and it should typically be checked within a day.
