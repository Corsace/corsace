The following documentation is for setting up a local development environment for Corsace.

If you are looking into translating for Corsace, request access at https://translate.corsace.io, and join the [Corsace discord server](https://discord.gg/Z6vEMsr)

Please make sure to first [fork the repository](https://github.com/Corsace/Corsace/fork)

:::caution
We HIGHLY recommend installing a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to work on this project outside of the documentation site.
:::

### Initial Configuration

Duplicate `config/default.json` to `config/user/$USER.json`, `$USER` being your system username [(accessible via node's `process.env.USER` or `USERNAME`)](https://github.com/tusharmath/node-config-ts#using-files).

In a terminal, run `node`, then type `process.env.USER` to find out your username.

The values in your personal `config/user/$USER.json` config file will be referred to as `config` from now on.

### osu! API

`config.osu.v1.apiKey`

You can obtain your osu! API V1 key [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/)

```
config.osu.v2.clientId
config.osu.v2.clientSecret
```

You will need to create a "New OAuth Application" at the bottom of https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit.

Add `config.corsace.publicUrl + /api/login/osu/callback` to the `Application Callback URLs` section in the popup.

For example, if your `config.corsace.publicUrl` is `http://localhost:5000`, then the callback URL should be `http://localhost:5000/api/login/osu/callback`.

Afterwards, you will be given a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which you will need to add to your config to the respective fields.

```
config.osu.bancho
```

You can obtain your osu! IRC password from the same place as the osu OAuth Application at https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#irc.

If your account is a bot account, then make sure to have `botAccount` set to true; otherwise, make set it to false.

### Database

`config.database`

#### Setup

There are 2 ways to setup the database, either via Docker or manually.

##### Via Docker (Recommended)

We are shipping a production-like `docker-compose.yml` file. You can start only the database service using: `docker-compose up -d database` or `npm run database`.

The database will listen on `127.0.0.1:3306`, with `corsace` being the database name, username and password.

##### Manual MariaDB Setup

If you do not want to use Docker, you will need to install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and create an empty database, named whatever you like. 

It can be as simple as running:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
MySQL> create database <new_db_name>; 
```

Make sure to update `config.database` to reflect your choice of database name and credentials.

#### Seeding the Database

Seed the whole Corsace database using: `NODE_ENV=development npm run -- typeorm migration:run -d ormconfig`

### Object Storage/S3

We use S3-compatible object storage for storing and serving mappacks, configured in `config.s3`.

While we target Cloudflare R2, any S3 provider should work as long as they support multipart uploads and pre-signed URLs.

We use three buckets:

- `team-avatars` is a public bucket that stores team avatars, can be served by a CDN without authentication
- `mappacks` is a public bucket that stores public mappacks, can be served by a CDN without authentication
- `mappacks-temp` is a private bucket that stores private mappacks that should not have public access  

Generated mappacks are first uploaded to this bucket, users are given access through pre-signed URLs.

Private mappacks are not meant to be permanently stored, a lifecycle policy should be added to that bucket to automatically delete objects after 1 day.

Mappacks that should become public get moved to the `mappacks` bucket.

#### Cloudflare R2

Go to the [Cloudflare R2 dashboard page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2). Enable your plan if you haven't already (good luck exceeding free limits).

Create the `mappacks` and `team-avatars` buckets and enable their R2.dev subdomains, or associate a custom domain for each.

Create the `mappacks-temp` bucket and add an object lifecycle rule to delete objects after 7 days (leave prefix empty).

Set hostname to `<cloudflare account id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, and obtain S3 credentials from https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/api-tokens. **Make sure you give the token `Edit` permissions instead of the default `Read` permissions.**

### Discord

`config.discord`

#### Setup

This is the most time-consuming part of the setup. 
You will need the following:

##### Enable Developer Mode

Check the option at 

```
User Settings > Appearance > Advanced > Developer Mode
```

This will allow you to right click users, roles, channels, etc to copy their IDs.

##### A Discord Server

Create a new Discord Server if you don't have one already. All it needs to have is a single channel.
Create a "staff" role and give it to yourself.

Right-click your server name and "Copy ID". Paste this into `config.discord.guild`.

Right-click your staff role and "Copy ID". You can either create a role for each corresponding role in the config, OR 
paste that role ID into the following config values to give yourself god-tier permissions.

```
config.discord.roles.corsace.corsace
config.discord.roles.corsace.core
config.discord.roles.corsace.headStaff
config.discord.roles.corsace.staff
```

and then into every other "staff" role in the config.

##### Discord Application

Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a "New Application".

###### Client

You will need to add the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" to the config as follows:

```json
discord: {
    ...,
    clientId: "<Client ID>",
    clientSecret: "<Client Secret>",
}
```

The client ID and secret are found in the discord application's `OAuth2` tab.\\

###### OAuth2

Head to the OAuth2 section of the bot and add the following redirect URL:

```
config.corsace.publicUrl + /api/login/discord/callback
```

Also add a redirect URL with your bot's specific Client ID that looks like:

```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<CLIENT ID>&scope=bot&permissions=8
```

Follow this link to add your bot to your server.

###### Bot

Head to the `Bot` section of the Discord application and copy your bot token. 
Paste it into `config.discord.token`

Ensure you enable the `Server Members` and `Message Content` intents under the **Privileged Gateway Intents** subsection before usage, the bot will not start otherwise, and you will be provided a `[DISALLOWED INTENTS]` error.

###### GitHub Webhook

Completely optional, and only if you really want to track your GitHub fork's events on discord and want to utilize Corsace's Github Webhook.

In the discord channel you want to obtain GitHub notifications from, create a webhook from `settings -> Integrations -> Create Webhook`, copy its Webhook URL, and place it into your config in `config.github.webhookUrl`.
Create a password and place it in `config.github.webhookSecret`.

On GitHub, go to the repository's settings, and create a new webhook. Place the following URL in:

```
config.corsace.publicUrl + /api/github
```

Set the content type to `application/json`, and the secret to the password you created earlier.

### Centrifugo

We use Centrifugo for real-time notifications. You can find the documentation [here](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction).

#### Setup

On Unix:
Run `npm run centrifugo` to start the centrifugo server. It will be available at `http://localhost:8001` by default, unless you change the port in the config files.

On WSL/Windows OR if the above doesn't work:
Download the binary from [latest releases](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/releases), and add it to the root folder of this project.
Afterwards, run `npm run centrifugo:local` to start the centrifugo server. If you want to change the port, change the `-p` flag in the respective script in `package.json`, and your config file's api URL.

## Next Steps

For frontend web development, it's suggested to go through the following documents in order:

- [Server + CronRunner - Running Environment](server/guide/server-running-environment)
- [Web - Running Environment](client/guide/web-running-environment)

For docs development, you can simply go [here](client/guide/docs-running-environment)

For any specific backend development, you can go to their respective `Running Environment` pages in `Server/Guide` from the sidebar.
